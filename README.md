<p>Voice conversion represents converting one speaker’s voice into another speaker’s. It is an interesting topic and has many valuable use cases. In this project, we aims at building a voice conversion system using recurrent neural networks. We have two networks. The first one converts the source audio into a series of phones(phonemes) while the second one uses those phones to generate the target audio. It turns out our model works pretty well when converting from a speaker in TIMIT dataset to a U.S. female - the output audio is smooth, accurate, and natural.</p>
